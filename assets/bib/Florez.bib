	abstract = {Currently, there are no low-cost commercially available fluid control valves that are suitable for a wide range of wearable robotics applications. To address this market shortcoming, the Compact Robotic Flow Control (CRFC) has been recently introduced. This 3-way 3-position proportional control valve utilizing a servo to implement a choking mechanism that proportionally lessens or widens the inlet opening takes up only 1/7th of the volume and 1/10th of the weight of the best on-off commercially available valve unit in the same “cost” range. It also exhibits relatively fast response times comparable to the response time of on-off valves priced roughly 10 times more than the CRFC valve manufacturing cost. The CRFC valve is reviewed in detail and ongoing work on several advanced applications including wearable exosuit is discussed.},

	abstract = {We present GTGraffiti, a graffiti painting system from Georgia Tech that tackles challenges in art, hardware, and human-robot collaboration. The problem of painting graffiti in a human style is particularly challenging and requires a system-level approach because the robotics and art must be designed around each other. The robot must be highly dynamic over a large workspace while the artist must work within the robot's limitations. Our approach consists of three stages: artwork capture, robot hardware, and planning \& control. We use motion capture to capture collaborator painting motions which are then composed and processed into a time-varying linear feedback controller for a cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) to execute. In this work, we will describe the capturing process, the design and construction of a purpose-built CDPR, and the software for turning an artist's vision into control commands. Our work represents an important step towards faithfully recreating human graffiti artwork by demonstrating that we can reproduce artist motions up to 2m/s and 20m/s\${\textasciicircum}2\$ within 9.3mm RMSE to paint artworks.

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {To expand extra-planetary mission support capabilities, highly specialized robotic systems are developed and implemented that are not generalized enough for successful 
implementation across multiple environments. Here, a tetrapodal robot capable of task-oriented locomotion and manipulation is envisioned that can serve as a robust 
platform for mission support across multiple gravitational environments. The proposed system, referred to as the Trans-Gravitational Robot (TGR), is anticipated to 
operate in orbital, Lunar, and Martian environments by employing dexterous limbs capable of compliant actuation for both locomotion and manipulation. 
A simplified robot limb design with variable stiffness and compliance is proposed as a proof of concept of essential technologies for the development of the TGR. Antagonistic actuation is achieved using a novel, nonlinear, torsional spring module, coined the Bidirectional Elastic Nonlinear Element (BENE). A design approach for this elastic element as produced, which allows for scalable and customizable elastic element designs to be produced using the same basic approach. The implementation of the BENE modules for antagonistic actuation enabled the decoupled and straightforward control of position and stiffness. The BENE and its accompanying control scheme were developed and validated as proof-of-concept for variable stiffness actuation for the TGR limb.},

I am a Robotics PhD student in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), where I study single-agent and multi-agent visual navigation systems for autonomous agents in space. I am currently advised by [Dr. Panagiotis Tsiotras](https://dcsl.gatech.edu/tsiotras.html) and work alongside [Dr. Mehregan Dor](https://mehregandor.github.io/about_me/) and [Iason Velentzas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iasonvelentzas/). I was previously involved in research effort led by [Dr. Frank Delllaert](https://dellaert.github.io/) for artistic human-robot collaboration, where I collaborated with [Gerry Chen](https://gerry-chen.com/about/).

I started at Georgia Tech in Fall 2020 after completing my MS in Robotics Engineering at the [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/), where I worked with [Felix Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixsanchez5/) on actuation and control for biomimetic robotic systems. Before that, I recieved my BS in Mechanical Engineering at the [Florida institute of Technology](https://www.fit.edu/).

When I am not focused on my research, I like to spend my time playing board games, table-top role-playing games, and video games. I also enjoy riding my bike around Atlanta, playing racquetball, and learning to songs on the piano.

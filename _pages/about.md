I am a Robotics PhD student in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) under [Dr. Frank Dellaert](https://dellaert.github.io/).

I started at Georgia Tech in Fall 2020 after completing my MS in Robotics Engineering at the [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). Before that, I recieved my BS in Mechanical Engineering at the [Florida institute of Technology](https://www.fit.edu/).

My research involves graphical model techniques and their applications in robotics. Thus, I contribute to [GTSAM](https://gtsam.org) in the areas of kinodynamic modeling, control, and trajectory optimization and representation.

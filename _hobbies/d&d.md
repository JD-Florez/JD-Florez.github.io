I first started this campaign in May of 2020, having been inspired to do so the dungeon master of my first experience in D&D, Felix Sanchez.

I started with a simple story about a cursed desert teeming with undead, but that story grew into what is now turning out to be a multi-year campaign full of memorable moments spent with wonderful friends and my lovely wife.

In DMing I've learned how to:
- organize adults with disparate schedules
- manage my time (if only slightly better)
- get good at improvisational storytelling

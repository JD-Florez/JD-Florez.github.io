I currently use an Electrovoice RE20 hooked up to a GoXLR Mini for some minor voiceover auditions. I chose this microphone for the quality, and I chose this interface for its usefulness in streaming/broadcasting on platforms such as Twitch. I have yet to land any roles, but here's hoping!

One of my goals this spring is to submit an audition recording every two weeks!

I first started this campaign in May of 2020, as I was inspired by the fantastic Dungeon Master (Felix Sanchez) of my first foray into D&D. I started with a simple story about a cursed desert teeming with undead, but that story grew into what is now turning out to be a multi-year campaign full of memorale moments spent with wonderful friends and my lovely wife. In DMing I've learned how to organize adults with disparate schedules, manage my time (if only slightly better), and embrace my love of unbridled imagination and improvisational storytelling.

I worked under [Dr. Glenn Lightsey](https://ae.gatech.edu/people/edgar-glenn-lightsey) and [Dr. Britney Schmidt](https://ocean.gatech.edu/people/dr-britney-schmidt) in a team of 34 people to progress the design and development of the (VERNE robot)[https://ssdl.gatech.edu/research/projects/vernevertical-entry-robot-navigating-europa].

I was responsible for helping to progress the design of the drill head of the probe and finalize the design and evaluation protocol for the thermal anchoring mechanism.

More info coming soon!

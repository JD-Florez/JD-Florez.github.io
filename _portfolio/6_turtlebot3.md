Applied knowledge of robot control, computer vision, and classification to enable a Turtlebot3 to navigate a maze using a camera and LIDAR to avoid collisions and navigate using colored signs that revealed the correct path. The robot created a virtual map of the maze as it navigated it, allowing it to backtrack and correct its chosen path when mistakes were made.

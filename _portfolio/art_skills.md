This a research project funded by NSF involving the application of robotics to artistic endeavors. My involvement in the project includes:
- Trajectory representation (Sigma Lognormal Method for human trajectory representation)
- Trajectory estimation/optimization (applied factor graphs using GTSAM)
- Impedance matching and control of the Franka Emika Panda manipulator for teleoperated trajectory generation

I'm learning GTSAM and GTDynamics for this... Let's hope it goes well! This pays the bills :)

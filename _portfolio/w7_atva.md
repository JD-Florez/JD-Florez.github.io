I will be creating the ATVA system (Anomaly-Tracking for Vision-Aversion), which consists of a helmet-mounted object tracking camera and the required sensors for *visual contact prevention*. Find the proposal here: [ATVA Proposal](/pdf/atva_proposal.pdf).

This project was inspired by the short film [096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOZkf4imaM), which features [SCP-096](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096)â€”a humanoid monster that becomes aggressively distressed when its face is viewed. To prevent visual contact, a researcher creates the SCRAMBLE Goggles, which use facial recognition and local image scrambling to prevent military operatives from seeing SCP-096's face.

An IMU, IR-distance sensor, and the aforementioned camera will be used to track a fiducial marker and notify the user when it is entering their field of vision (FOV), as shown in the figure below.

The transformation from center of FOV to edge of FOV is critical to this project.

More info coming soon!

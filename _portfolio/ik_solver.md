I work with Andrew Schueler on analytically solving the IK model of 7-DOF robot robot arms. Topics explored in our methodology:
- Self motion
- Kinematic modeling of manipulators with joint offsets at the wrist and elbow (such as the Franka Emika Panda)

I can share more details after the initial Arxiv publication.
 We are working to submit to IROS in March!

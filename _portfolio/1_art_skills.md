This a research project funded by NSF involving human-robot collaboration in artistic endeavors. My involvement in the project includes:
- Human-generated trajectory representation and generation
  - Human-generated velocity modeling for robot motion trajectories
  - Trajectory parameter optimization using factor graphs and Levenberg-Marquardt optimization (GTSAM)
- Teleoperation of Franka Emika Panda for artistic endeavors
  - Impedance matching and control
  - Haptic bilateral teleoperation using a Novint Falcon haptic device
- Help with evaluation step of cable-driven parallel robot (CDPR) for GTGraffiti project
  - Paper accepted to ICRA 2022

I can share more details after the initial Arxiv publication.
We are planning to submit to IROS in March!

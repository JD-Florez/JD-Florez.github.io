I led a team of ~20 people in designing and developing two mini rovers, each equipped with a rocker bogie suspension, differential (to keep the chassis level), a 5-DOF robot manipulator, and a camera for robot vision. We used model-based systems engineering methods to aid our system design processes.

This was my sensior design project for my undergraduate studies in mechanical engineering.

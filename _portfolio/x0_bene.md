The project was my MS thesis, and consisted of the development of a methodology used to design an elastic element for variable stiffness actuation. The elastic element consisted of spring steel leaves that are spread radially around a hub within a shell that has jamming extrusions within it. As an actuator rotates the central hub, the leaves will collide with and deflect against the extrusions, causing a nonlinear stiffness response.

The method used to custom-design this elastic element for use in systems with desired performance requirements is outlined in my thesis document.

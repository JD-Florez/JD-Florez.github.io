I will be creating the ATVA system (Anomaly-Tracking for Vision-Aversion), which consists of a helmet-mounted object tracking camera and the required sensors for *visual contact prevention*.

This project was inspired by the short film [096](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEOZkf4imaM), which features [SCP-096](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096)â€”a humanoid monster that becomes aggressively distressed when its face is viewed. To prevent visual contact, a researcher creates the SCRAMBLE Goggles, which use facial recognition and local image scrambling to prevent military operatives from seeing SCP-096's face.

An IMU, IR-distance sensor, and the aforementioned camera will be used to track a fiducial marker and notify the user when it is entering their field of vision. Pitch and yaw angular displacements and distance to the marker will be used as system outputs.

More info coming soon!
